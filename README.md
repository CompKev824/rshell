# rshell

Welcome to Rshell. This is a basic command prompt!

As of right now, it is under construction. But here are some basic things that you need to know:

1. The command prompt prints your username, followed by the name of the hostname os the machine.

2. The command prompt can only take in one command at a time, so you cannot use connectors such as || or && or ;

3. Comments can be placed anywhere in the command such as "ls -a#this is the ls command ".

Sorry for the inconveniences. It is a work in progress.
